This file describes the use and operation of the TrafficLight App.


Installation/Equipment:

The TrafficLight App is designed to toggle the lights on a modified Traffic Light from LavaLamp.  Specifically, the following alterations have been performed:
  Mounting taken apart.
  Control chip removed from circuit board.
  Negative wired to TelosB negative port.
  Positive wired to TelosB positive port.
  Pins for controlling each of the lights in the traffic light added to three extension slots on the TelosB board. (6.0 for yellow, 6.1 for green, 6.2 for red)
  3rd Battery shorted using a wire on the Traffic Light.


Once equipped, this application can be installed on the TelosB connected to the traffic light using the standard toolset (make telosb install)

Operation:

  Upon startup, the application will set the light to Red.  In general, the LEDs will mirror the light status except in cases where there is a yellow light (green led left on).

  The mote will listen for packets from a TeacherAcoustic application.  Upon hearing a packet, it will act based on the contents of that packet.

  For Red Packets:
	The mote will check if the light is already red.  If it is, no effect.  If not, it will turn off green, turn on the yellow light, and then set a timer to change the red light to on after 1 second.

  For Green Packets:
	The mote will set a green timer (if not already running) for a period in the future defined in the packet.  Upon firing that timer, it will turn off all lights and turn on the green light (both LED and light).

  The mote can run off the batteries of the light if needed.  USB will power both mote and light, but only dimly on the light.
